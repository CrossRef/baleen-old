## Installation

Create `config.edn`. Create mysql database with `etc/schema/sql`.

The Wikipedia Recent Changes stream uses an obsolete version of Socket.IO, so we need to use an unsupported version. To install:

 - download and build per instructions at https://github.com/Gottox/socket.io-java-client
 - put the JAR in `lib`
 - `lein localrepo install lib/socketio.jar gottox/socketio "0.1"`
 - `lein run`
